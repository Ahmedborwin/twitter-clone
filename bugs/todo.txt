generate random users + tweets has an issue and work irreglurly

deleting a tweet and refreshign does not send you to the home page on first try

my users tweets are not displaying correctly..
i think it has something to do with lack of avator

load more for tweet replies is not working. I cannot get api/tweets to look at the correct table read function based on if statement - it just skips both and i end up with an empty array

------------------------------

things to do 

add display more button to tweet replies
Only display load more button aslong as there are more tweets to display
